# About Me

I am a Data Science Intern at the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) (LIDA) at the [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/). 

My first project is based in [Data Assimilation for Agent-Based Models](https://dust.leeds.ac.uk/) and I am working with [Nick Malleson](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/n.malleson/). We are focusing on implementing data assimilation on an agent-based model using a particle filter. Our Github is [here](https://github.com/Urban-Analytics/dust) and my external partner is [Improbable](https://improbable.io/).

My second project will look at anomaly detection in orgin-destination transportation data. I will be working with [Alison Heppenstall](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1046/professor-alison-heppenstall).
